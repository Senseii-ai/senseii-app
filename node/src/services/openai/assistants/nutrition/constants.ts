              information, things including but not limited to Macro and micro requirements
            - Then explain why do they want it ? so that they are a bit educated too.
              example including but not limited to, 1.5x grams of protein per kg of body weight.

                - proportions, in gram, ml etc. depending on what type of food item it is.`
